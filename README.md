# Project-Nimi

## My first Project

This is my first project after learning some HTML and CSS for about five days. I know, that there might be some errors or strange uses of some elements or selectors, but I will improve this in a second version of this project. This shall be my first "success" I can come back to, to compare my learning curve after the first week of learning. :blush:

Still working on my skills and trying out new things to learn.
